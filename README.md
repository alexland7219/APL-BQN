# BQN and APL
Solutions in BQN and Dyalog APL to some problems

APL, short for A Programming Language, is a high-level, domain-specific programming language developed by Kenneth E. Iverson in the 1960s. Known for its concise syntax and use of special characters, APL is designed for mathematical, scientific, and engineering applications. Dyalog APL is a modern, commercial implementation of APL. It extends the original APL language with additional features and improvements:

BQN is a derivative of APL developed by Marshall Lochbaum. It aims to modernize and simplify the concepts of APL while maintaining its array-oriented nature.
